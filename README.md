# GTTL-dataset
This **German traffic transfer learning** (GTTL)-dataset contains more than xxx,xxx images with more in xx classes. The class system is based on the German road traffic regulation (StVo) and covers traffic signs lights and vehicles. The dataset contains city, villages, country roads, federal roads and highway scenes in different weather conditions, daytimes and time of year. It includes a variation of corner cases like extreme light, snow and rain to validate Deep Learning algorithms.

 [RPi 4 Tuning guide*](https://github.com/Petros626/GTTL-dataset/blob/main/RPi%204%20Tuning%20Guide.pdf). Of course the values are not limited, but for me the focus was on a combination of performance and safety. If necessary, I will adjust the values for the CPU and GPU.

## Setup

## Outlook
For automated camera triggering to create the dataset, GPS triggering would be a good method. The Raspberry Pi with a GPS module (e.g. [Neo-6M GPS](https://www.berrybase.de/fr/u-blox-neo-6m-gps-ttl-empfaenger-inkl.-antenne) with [pynmea2](https://github.com/Knio/pynmea2) or [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) library could be used for this. The calculation of the distance travelled can be achieved manually (**pynmea2**) or via ready-made functions (**geopy**). 
The question arises after how many metres the camera should trigger, are there statistics after how many metres on average in road traffic one follows the other or does one refer to already created data sets, such as that of [EvoTegra](https://www.evotegra.de/datasets), which used a distance of 4m per triggering. In itself, it might be a good idea to start with a trigger distance of 4 m
